# Forecasting_Methods_Performed_on_Dataset

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project required me to analyses multiple datasets using time series forecasting techniques with R and RStudio. In order to assess forecast accuracy and residuals, I had to gather and extract data, generate training-test splits, and use seasonal naive and drift forecasting techniques. I imported, transformed, and visualised the datasets, evaluted whether variance-stabilizing modification are necessary, and compared mean, naive, seasonal naive, and drift projections using RMSE and MAPE. In order to determine predictor significance, I also create a multivariate regression model, examine correlations between different components, and built a regression model with trend and seasonal components.
